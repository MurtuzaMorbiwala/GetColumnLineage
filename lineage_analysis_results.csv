jaffle_shop.customers,ID,NUMBER,,,[],"Upstream Column(s): None
Reasoning: The column ""ID"" is a common primary key column that is typically generated by the database or assigned sequentially. It is unlikely that it was derived from another column."
jaffle_shop.customers,FIRST_NAME,TEXT,,,[],"Upstream Column(s): [first_name, name, contact_name]
Reasoning: The column name ""FIRST_NAME"" suggests that it may have been derived from a column named ""first_name"" or ""name"" in an upstream table. Additionally, ""contact_name"" is a common column name for tables that store customer information and could have been used to derive the ""FIRST_NAME"" column."
jaffle_shop.customers,LAST_NAME,TEXT,,,[],"Upstream Column(s): [first_name, last_name]
Reasoning: The ""LAST_NAME"" column in the ""jaffle_shop.customers"" model is typically used to store the last name of a customer. It is likely that this column was created by combining two upstream columns: ""first_name"" and ""last_name"". This is a common data transformation when creating a customer table, as it allows for easy searching and filtering of customers by their full name."
jaffle_shop.orders,ID,NUMBER,,,[],"Upstream Column(s): []
Reasoning: The provided information does not provide any context or clues regarding the upstream column(s) that were used to create the ""ID"" column in the ""jaffle_shop.orders"" model. Therefore, it's not possible to identify the likely upstream column(s) based on the information provided."
jaffle_shop.orders,USER_ID,NUMBER,,,[],"Upstream Column(s): [USERS.ID]
Reasoning: The column USER_ID in the jaffle_shop.orders table is likely sourced from the ID column in the USERS table, which typically stores user identifiers. The naming convention of jaffle_shop.orders.USER_ID implies a relationship with the USERS table."
jaffle_shop.orders,ORDER_DATE,DATE,,,[],"Upstream Column(s): [jaffle_shop.orders.DATE]
Reasoning: The ORDER_DATE column is of type DATE, which often represents a truncated timestamp or a date that has been extracted from a larger timestamp. It is likely that the source column used to create the ORDER_DATE column was a timestamp column in the jaffle_shop.orders table, and that this column was truncated or otherwise transformed to create the ORDER_DATE column."
jaffle_shop.orders,STATUS,TEXT,,,[],"Upstream Column(s): None
Reasoning: The column STATUS is a text column and it doesn't have any upstream columns as per the metadata provided."
jaffle_shop.orders,_ETL_LOADED_AT,TIMESTAMP_NTZ,,,[],"Upstream Column(s): _ETL_EXTRACTED_AT, _ETL_TRANSFORMED_AT
Reasoning: Columns with names like ""_ETL_LOADED_AT"" typically store the timestamp when data was loaded into a target system. In this case, the data is likely being loaded from another system or process, so the upstream columns would be those that store the timestamps when the data was extracted and transformed."
stripe.payment,ID,NUMBER,,,[],"Upstream Column(s): [stripe.charge.ID]
Reasoning: The column name ""ID"" and the upstream model ""stripe.payment"" suggest that this column contains the unique identifier for a payment. The ""stripe.charge"" model is a likely upstream model as it typically contains payment-related information, and the ""ID"" column in that model would be a suitable source for the ""ID"" column in the ""stripe.payment"" model."
stripe.payment,ORDERID,NUMBER,,,[],"Upstream Column(s): invoice.id, invoicedetail.id
Reasoning: The column name ""ORDERID"" suggests that it is a unique identifier for an order, which is typically stored in the `invoice` or `invoicedetail` table."
stripe.payment,PAYMENTMETHOD,TEXT,,,[],"Upstream Column(s): stripe.customer.PAYMENTMETHOD
Reasoning: The PAYMENTMETHOD column in the stripe.payment model is likely derived from the PAYMENTMETHOD column in the stripe.customer model, as it is a common practice to store payment methods for a customer in a separate table."
stripe.payment,STATUS,TEXT,,,[],"Upstream Column(s): [stripe.payment.ID, stripe.payment.object, stripe.payment.created, stripe.payment.modified]
Reasoning: The STATUS column is likely derived from the ID, object, created, and modified columns of the stripe.payment upstream model. These columns provide information about the payment status. For example, the ID column can be used to track the payment status, the object column can be used to identify the type of payment object, the created column can be used to determine when the payment was initiated, and the modified column can be used to track any changes to the payment status."
stripe.payment,AMOUNT,NUMBER,,,[],"Upstream Column(s): [stripe.invoice.total]
Reasoning: The column name ""AMOUNT"" suggests that it may represent a monetary value. ""stripe.invoice.total"" is a common upstream column that represents the total amount due on an invoice, which could potentially be used to calculate the ""AMOUNT"" column in ""stripe.payment""."
stripe.payment,CREATED,DATE,,,[],"**Upstream Column(s):** N/A

**Reasoning:** The `CREATED` column in the `stripe.payment` model is a DATE type, which is typically used to store the date and time when a record was created. This column is not likely to have been derived from another column, as it is a common field in many databases."
stripe.payment,_BATCHED_AT,TIMESTAMP_NTZ,,,[],"Upstream Column(s): stripe.payment.CREATED
Reasoning: Batching typically occurs based on the time of creation of the payment. The _BATCHED_AT column is most likely based on the stripe.payment.CREATED column, which represents the time when the payment was created."
customers,CUSTOMER_ID,NUMBER,,,"[{""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_customers"", ""name"": ""stg_customers"", ""columns"": [""CUSTOMER_ID"", ""FIRST_NAME"", ""LAST_NAME""]}, {""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_orders"", ""name"": ""stg_orders"", ""columns"": [""ORDER_ID"", ""CUSTOMER_ID"", ""ORDER_DATE"", ""STATUS""]}]","Upstream Column(s): stg_customers.CUSTOMER_ID
Reasoning: The column CUSTOMER_ID in the customers model is of type NUMBER and has the same name as the CUSTOMER_ID column in the stg_customers model, which is a staging table for customer data. This suggests that the CUSTOMER_ID column in the customers model was likely created from the CUSTOMER_ID column in the stg_customers model during the data transformation process."
customers,FIRST_NAME,TEXT,,,"[{""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_customers"", ""name"": ""stg_customers"", ""columns"": [""CUSTOMER_ID"", ""FIRST_NAME"", ""LAST_NAME""]}, {""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_orders"", ""name"": ""stg_orders"", ""columns"": [""ORDER_ID"", ""CUSTOMER_ID"", ""ORDER_DATE"", ""STATUS""]}]","    Upstream Column(s): [model.jaffle_shop.stg_customers.FIRST_NAME]
    Reasoning: The column FIRST_NAME in the customers model has the same name and data type as the column FIRST_NAME in the stg_customers model.
    It is likely that the data in the customers model was extracted from the stg_customers model."
customers,LAST_NAME,TEXT,,,"[{""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_customers"", ""name"": ""stg_customers"", ""columns"": [""CUSTOMER_ID"", ""FIRST_NAME"", ""LAST_NAME""]}, {""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_orders"", ""name"": ""stg_orders"", ""columns"": [""ORDER_ID"", ""CUSTOMER_ID"", ""ORDER_DATE"", ""STATUS""]}]","Upstream Column(s): stg_customers.LAST_NAME
Reasoning: The name of the column in the customers model, LAST_NAME, matches the name of a column in the stg_customers model, also called LAST_NAME. Additionally, it is common for a column in a downstream model to be derived from a column in an upstream model with the same or similar name."
customers,FIRST_ORDER_DATE,DATE,,,"[{""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_customers"", ""name"": ""stg_customers"", ""columns"": [""CUSTOMER_ID"", ""FIRST_NAME"", ""LAST_NAME""]}, {""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_orders"", ""name"": ""stg_orders"", ""columns"": [""ORDER_ID"", ""CUSTOMER_ID"", ""ORDER_DATE"", ""STATUS""]}]","Upstream Column: stg_orders.ORDER_DATE
Reasoning: The column FIRST_ORDER_DATE is likely derived from the ORDER_DATE column in the stg_orders table. This is a common pattern where the first occurrence of an event (in this case, the first order) is captured as a separate column."
customers,MOST_RECENT_ORDER_DATE,DATE,,,"[{""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_customers"", ""name"": ""stg_customers"", ""columns"": [""CUSTOMER_ID"", ""FIRST_NAME"", ""LAST_NAME""]}, {""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_orders"", ""name"": ""stg_orders"", ""columns"": [""ORDER_ID"", ""CUSTOMER_ID"", ""ORDER_DATE"", ""STATUS""]}]","**Upstream Column(s):** ['stg_orders.ORDER_DATE']
**Reasoning:** The name of the column, 'MOST_RECENT_ORDER_DATE', suggests that it is the most recent order date for each customer. The 'stg_orders' table contains the order dates for each customer, so it is likely that this column was derived from the 'ORDER_DATE' column in that table."
customers,NUMBER_OF_ORDERS,NUMBER,,,"[{""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_customers"", ""name"": ""stg_customers"", ""columns"": [""CUSTOMER_ID"", ""FIRST_NAME"", ""LAST_NAME""]}, {""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_orders"", ""name"": ""stg_orders"", ""columns"": [""ORDER_ID"", ""CUSTOMER_ID"", ""ORDER_DATE"", ""STATUS""]}]","**Upstream Column(s):** CUSTOMER_ID (stg_customers)

**Reasoning:** The NUMBER_OF_ORDERS column in the customers model likely represents the count of orders placed by each customer. The CUSTOMER_ID column in the stg_customers model is a unique identifier for each customer, and it is used as a foreign key in the stg_orders model to link orders to customers. Therefore, the CUSTOMER_ID column in the stg_customers model is the most likely upstream column that was used to create the NUMBER_OF_ORDERS column in the customers model."
stg_payments,ID,NUMBER,,,"[{""id"": ""source.jaffle_shop.stripe.payment"", ""name"": ""stripe.payment"", ""columns"": [""ID"", ""ORDERID"", ""PAYMENTMETHOD"", ""STATUS"", ""AMOUNT"", ""CREATED"", ""_BATCHED_AT""]}]","Upstream Column(s): stripe.payment.ID
Reasoning: The column name ""ID"" in the stg_payments table is a common naming convention for primary keys. The upstream table, stripe.payment, also has a column named ""ID"" which is likely the source of the primary key in the stg_payments table."
stg_payments,ORDERID,NUMBER,,,"[{""id"": ""source.jaffle_shop.stripe.payment"", ""name"": ""stripe.payment"", ""columns"": [""ID"", ""ORDERID"", ""PAYMENTMETHOD"", ""STATUS"", ""AMOUNT"", ""CREATED"", ""_BATCHED_AT""]}]","Upstream Column(s):  stripe.payment.ID
Reasoning: The stg_payments.ORDERID column is of type NUMBER, which suggests that it was derived from a numeric column in the upstream model. The stripe.payment model has a column named ID that is also of type NUMBER and is a unique identifier for each payment. This makes it the most likely upstream column for the stg_payments.ORDERID column."
stg_payments,PAYMENTMETHOD,TEXT,,,"[{""id"": ""source.jaffle_shop.stripe.payment"", ""name"": ""stripe.payment"", ""columns"": [""ID"", ""ORDERID"", ""PAYMENTMETHOD"", ""STATUS"", ""AMOUNT"", ""CREATED"", ""_BATCHED_AT""]}]","**Upstream Column(s):** PAYMENTMETHOD
**Reasoning:** The stg_payments.PAYMENTMETHOD column has the same name as the stripe.payment.PAYMENTMETHOD column. This suggests that the stripe.payment.PAYMENTMETHOD column was used to create the stg_payments.PAYMENTMETHOD column."
stg_payments,STATUS,TEXT,,,"[{""id"": ""source.jaffle_shop.stripe.payment"", ""name"": ""stripe.payment"", ""columns"": [""ID"", ""ORDERID"", ""PAYMENTMETHOD"", ""STATUS"", ""AMOUNT"", ""CREATED"", ""_BATCHED_AT""]}]","Upstream Column: stripe.payment.STATUS
Reasoning: The column name STATUS in both the upstream and downstream models suggests a direct lineage, as they serve the same purpose of capturing the status of a payment."
stg_payments,AMOUNT,NUMBER,,,"[{""id"": ""source.jaffle_shop.stripe.payment"", ""name"": ""stripe.payment"", ""columns"": [""ID"", ""ORDERID"", ""PAYMENTMETHOD"", ""STATUS"", ""AMOUNT"", ""CREATED"", ""_BATCHED_AT""]}]","Upstream Column(s): [stg_payments.AMOUNT]
Reasoning: The column name is identical to the upstream column name, suggesting a direct lineage."
stg_payments,CREATED,DATE,,,"[{""id"": ""source.jaffle_shop.stripe.payment"", ""name"": ""stripe.payment"", ""columns"": [""ID"", ""ORDERID"", ""PAYMENTMETHOD"", ""STATUS"", ""AMOUNT"", ""CREATED"", ""_BATCHED_AT""]}]","**Upstream Column(s):** stripe.payment.CREATED

**Reasoning:** The stg_payments.CREATED column is of type DATE, which suggests that it may have been derived from a timestamp column. The upstream column stripe.payment.CREATED is also of type DATE, and it has the same name as the stg_payments.CREATED column. This suggests that the stg_payments.CREATED column was likely derived from the stripe.payment.CREATED column."
stg_payments,_BATCHED_AT,TIMESTAMP_NTZ,,,"[{""id"": ""source.jaffle_shop.stripe.payment"", ""name"": ""stripe.payment"", ""columns"": [""ID"", ""ORDERID"", ""PAYMENTMETHOD"", ""STATUS"", ""AMOUNT"", ""CREATED"", ""_BATCHED_AT""]}]","Upstream Column(s): [_BATCHED_AT]
Reasoning: The column name ""_BATCHED_AT"" is identical in both the upstream and downstream columns, suggesting a direct lineage between them."
cltv,CUSTOMER_ID,NUMBER,,,"[{""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_customers"", ""name"": ""stg_customers"", ""columns"": [""CUSTOMER_ID"", ""FIRST_NAME"", ""LAST_NAME""]}, {""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_orders"", ""name"": ""stg_orders"", ""columns"": [""ORDER_ID"", ""CUSTOMER_ID"", ""ORDER_DATE"", ""STATUS""]}, {""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_payments"", ""name"": ""stg_payments"", ""columns"": [""ID"", ""ORDERID"", ""PAYMENTMETHOD"", ""STATUS"", ""AMOUNT"", ""CREATED"", ""_BATCHED_AT""]}]","Upstream Column: stg_customers.CUSTOMER_ID
Reasoning: The column name CUSTOMER_ID in the cltv model matches the column name in the stg_customers upstream model. This match between names often indicates a direct lineage between columns, suggesting that the stg_customers.CUSTOMER_ID column was used to create the cltv.CUSTOMER_ID column."
cltv,TOTAL_REVENUE,NUMBER,,,"[{""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_customers"", ""name"": ""stg_customers"", ""columns"": [""CUSTOMER_ID"", ""FIRST_NAME"", ""LAST_NAME""]}, {""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_orders"", ""name"": ""stg_orders"", ""columns"": [""ORDER_ID"", ""CUSTOMER_ID"", ""ORDER_DATE"", ""STATUS""]}, {""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_payments"", ""name"": ""stg_payments"", ""columns"": [""ID"", ""ORDERID"", ""PAYMENTMETHOD"", ""STATUS"", ""AMOUNT"", ""CREATED"", ""_BATCHED_AT""]}]","Upstream Column(s): stg_payments.AMOUNT

Reasoning: The column TOTAL_REVENUE in the model cltv is of type NUMBER and its description suggests that it represents the total revenue generated. A common way to calculate revenue is to sum up the amount of payments received. Looking at the upstream models, we see that stg_payments has a column called AMOUNT, which is most likely to be used to calculate the total revenue."
cltv,AVERAGE_ORDER_INTERVAL,NUMBER,,,"[{""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_customers"", ""name"": ""stg_customers"", ""columns"": [""CUSTOMER_ID"", ""FIRST_NAME"", ""LAST_NAME""]}, {""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_orders"", ""name"": ""stg_orders"", ""columns"": [""ORDER_ID"", ""CUSTOMER_ID"", ""ORDER_DATE"", ""STATUS""]}, {""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_payments"", ""name"": ""stg_payments"", ""columns"": [""ID"", ""ORDERID"", ""PAYMENTMETHOD"", ""STATUS"", ""AMOUNT"", ""CREATED"", ""_BATCHED_AT""]}]","**Upstream Column(s):** ORDER_DATE

**Reasoning:**

The column AVERAGE_ORDER_INTERVAL is likely calculated based on the ORDER_DATE column from the stg_orders table. This is because AVERAGE_ORDER_INTERVAL is a measure of the time between orders for a given customer, and ORDER_DATE is the column that tracks the date of each order."
orderfrequency,CUSTOMER_ID,NUMBER,,,"[{""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_customers"", ""name"": ""stg_customers"", ""columns"": [""CUSTOMER_ID"", ""FIRST_NAME"", ""LAST_NAME""]}, {""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_orders"", ""name"": ""stg_orders"", ""columns"": [""ORDER_ID"", ""CUSTOMER_ID"", ""ORDER_DATE"", ""STATUS""]}]","Upstream Column(s): CUSTOMER_ID (from stg_customers and stg_orders)
Reasoning: The orderfrequency column is likely derived from the stg_orders table, which contains information about orders placed by customers. The CUSTOMER_ID column in the orderfrequency table is likely a foreign key that references the CUSTOMER_ID column in the stg_customers table, which contains information about customers. This suggests that the orderfrequency column was created by joining the stg_orders and stg_customers tables on the CUSTOMER_ID column."
orderfrequency,NUMBER_OF_ORDERS,NUMBER,,,"[{""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_customers"", ""name"": ""stg_customers"", ""columns"": [""CUSTOMER_ID"", ""FIRST_NAME"", ""LAST_NAME""]}, {""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_orders"", ""name"": ""stg_orders"", ""columns"": [""ORDER_ID"", ""CUSTOMER_ID"", ""ORDER_DATE"", ""STATUS""]}]","Upstream Column: CUSTOMER_ID
Reasoning: The column NUMBER_OF_ORDERS is likely derived from a count aggregation of orders placed by each customer. The CUSTOMER_ID column in the stg_customers table is a candidate key for each customer, so it is a likely source for identifying unique customers."
orderfrequency,AVERAGE_ORDER_INTERVAL,NUMBER,,,"[{""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_customers"", ""name"": ""stg_customers"", ""columns"": [""CUSTOMER_ID"", ""FIRST_NAME"", ""LAST_NAME""]}, {""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_orders"", ""name"": ""stg_orders"", ""columns"": [""ORDER_ID"", ""CUSTOMER_ID"", ""ORDER_DATE"", ""STATUS""]}]","Upstream Column(s): stg_orders.ORDER_DATE

Reasoning: The name of the column, AVERAGE_ORDER_INTERVAL, suggests it is a measure of the time between orders. The most likely upstream column to provide this information is the ORDER_DATE column from the stg_orders table."
payment_success_rate,SUCCESS_RATE,NUMBER,,,"[{""id"": ""model.jaffle_shop.stg_payments"", ""name"": ""stg_payments"", ""columns"": [""ID"", ""ORDERID"", ""PAYMENTMETHOD"", ""STATUS"", ""AMOUNT"", ""CREATED"", ""_BATCHED_AT""]}]","Upstream Column(s): STATUS
Reasoning: The payment_success_rate model is likely derived from the stg_payments model, as it is the only upstream model mentioned. The STATUS column in the stg_payments model contains information about the status of payments, which can be used to calculate the success rate."
stg_orders,ORDER_ID,NUMBER,,,"[{""id"": ""source.jaffle_shop.jaffle_shop.orders"", ""name"": ""jaffle_shop.orders"", ""columns"": [""ID"", ""USER_ID"", ""ORDER_DATE"", ""STATUS"", ""_ETL_LOADED_AT""]}]","**Upstream Column(s):** 

* ID

**Reasoning:** 

The column ""ORDER_ID"" in the ""stg_orders"" table is likely to have been derived from the ""ID"" column in the ""jaffle_shop.orders"" table, as the name ""ORDER_ID"" suggests that it is a unique identifier for orders and ""ID"" is a common name for primary key columns."
stg_orders,CUSTOMER_ID,NUMBER,,,"[{""id"": ""source.jaffle_shop.jaffle_shop.orders"", ""name"": ""jaffle_shop.orders"", ""columns"": [""ID"", ""USER_ID"", ""ORDER_DATE"", ""STATUS"", ""_ETL_LOADED_AT""]}]","**Upstream Column(s):** USER_ID

**Reasoning:** The stg_orders table's CUSTOMER_ID column is likely derived from the jaffle_shop.orders table's USER_ID column. This inference is based on the assumption that the USER_ID column in the source table represents the customer who placed the order, which is consistent with the name of the CUSTOMER_ID column in the stg_orders table."
stg_orders,ORDER_DATE,DATE,,,"[{""id"": ""source.jaffle_shop.jaffle_shop.orders"", ""name"": ""jaffle_shop.orders"", ""columns"": [""ID"", ""USER_ID"", ""ORDER_DATE"", ""STATUS"", ""_ETL_LOADED_AT""]}]","Upstream Column(s): [jaffle_shop.orders.ORDER_DATE]
Reasoning: The stg_orders.ORDER_DATE column has the same name and data type as the jaffle_shop.orders.ORDER_DATE column in the upstream model, suggesting that the latter was used to populate the former."
stg_orders,STATUS,TEXT,,,"[{""id"": ""source.jaffle_shop.jaffle_shop.orders"", ""name"": ""jaffle_shop.orders"", ""columns"": [""ID"", ""USER_ID"", ""ORDER_DATE"", ""STATUS"", ""_ETL_LOADED_AT""]}]","Upstream Column(s): stg_orders.STATUS
Reasoning: The column name is the same as the column name in the upstream model, indicating that this column was likely directly copied from the upstream table without any transformations."
stg_customers,CUSTOMER_ID,NUMBER,,,"[{""id"": ""source.jaffle_shop.jaffle_shop.customers"", ""name"": ""jaffle_shop.customers"", ""columns"": [""ID"", ""FIRST_NAME"", ""LAST_NAME""]}]","Upstream Column(s): source.jaffle_shop.jaffle_shop.customers.ID
Reasoning: The CUSTOMER_ID column in the stg_customers model is likely to have been derived from the ID column in the upstream source.jaffle_shop.jaffle_shop.customers model, as both columns are of the NUMBER type and have similar names."
stg_customers,FIRST_NAME,TEXT,,,"[{""id"": ""source.jaffle_shop.jaffle_shop.customers"", ""name"": ""jaffle_shop.customers"", ""columns"": [""ID"", ""FIRST_NAME"", ""LAST_NAME""]}]","Upstream Column(s): [jaffle_shop.customers.FIRST_NAME]
Reasoning: The name of the column in the stg_customers model (FIRST_NAME) matches the name of a column in the upstream model (jaffle_shop.customers.FIRST_NAME). This suggests that the data in the stg_customers.FIRST_NAME column was likely derived from the jaffle_shop.customers.FIRST_NAME column."
stg_customers,LAST_NAME,TEXT,,,"[{""id"": ""source.jaffle_shop.jaffle_shop.customers"", ""name"": ""jaffle_shop.customers"", ""columns"": [""ID"", ""FIRST_NAME"", ""LAST_NAME""]}]","Upstream Column(s): jaffle_shop.customers.LAST_NAME
Reasoning: The column name LAST_NAME in the stg_customers model matches the column name LAST_NAME in the jaffle_shop.customers source, indicating a direct lineage between these columns."
